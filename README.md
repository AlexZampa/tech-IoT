# IoT Technologies

The aim of the course is to introduce the main HW and SW features of the technologies necessary for the realization of the Internet-of-Things (IoT) paradigm.

This repository contains all the lab activities requested by the course.

All the C code is to be deployed on a `Arduino Yun 2` board with additional sensor.
<br>
The Yun 2 has two processor:
  - Atmega 32U4 (AVR): for Arduino-style programming
  - Atheros AR9331 (MIPS): equipped with a minimal Linux (OpenWRT Linino), for advanced network connections and applications
